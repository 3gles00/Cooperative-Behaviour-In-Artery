# Smart-Following-Models-for-Mixed-Fleets

#This thesis build on the previous project “The effects of a mixed-capability vehicular fleet”. In that thesis 
#there came up multiple conclusions. One of them was that there was some issues when either when a conventional 
#vehicle either is in the middle or at the head of a train of mixed cars there can rise up some issues if and when 
#that car has to use hard or emergency brakes. Based on this the problem statement of this thesis if we can make a 
#protocol for the Connected Vehicles so that they can better communicate with each-other and have a better 
#cooperation process. In this goal we want to see how successfully we can have these Connected Vehicles separate 
#from the rest of the fleet and connect to each-other like a train in the hopes of minimizing the need for hard or 
#emergency braking. 

#The goal of this thesis is to develop a protocol for Connected Vehicles which will improve the Connected Vehicles 
#capabilities for connection, and segregation from the rest of a fleet of cars in the hopes of harmony, efficiency 
#and road safety. To achieve this goal this thesis will mainly focu on simulating highways where such connection
#between Smart Vehicles are possible. The simulation software used will be Eclipse SUMO, Omnet++, within the larger 
#Artery environment. To then get a larger sample size of the data larger servers will be used within Halmstad 
#University when the protocol is developed and compared to models where no protocol is incorporated. Different 
#levels of Connection and Automation for vehicles will also be used as a benchmark to compare the protocol to. 

#The thesis problem statement lies within the bounds of Computer Science (Datorteknik) to reach the goal of a 
#Bachelor thesis for Civilingenjör i Datorteknik. The project will be software related using things as 
#Eclipse SUMO, Vagerant Artery and Omnet++ to develop the protocol then go over to larger servers to simulate to 
#fullfill the projects goals. The thesis is built on the principles of the Vision Zero project and hopes to build 
#further on them. Mainly focusing on the Day 4 aspects of Cooperation for Road User Safety. It will also try to 
#solve and give answers to some problems that arose from the previous projects like “The effects of a 
#mixed-capability vehicular fleet” mainly what and how to handle the jumble problem in a mixed fleet of cars 
#heading down a road.
