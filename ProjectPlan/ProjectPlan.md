The goal for 50% reduced fatalities and injuries was later revised to the year 2020. Today the Vision Zero is a project spanning the globe, from Europe to North America to Austrailia and inbetween more and more countries have joined the project and it's progress[2]. Sweden has meet the first part of this projects goal of reducing the number of fatalities by half but the full project has still not been fully realised.
